Practice codes for learning O'Reilly Media's book "Python Data Science Handbook Second Edition - 2022"

Here, you can find all the codes I read and practiced in O'reilly Media's 2022 publication, "Python Data Science Handbook Second Edition." I wrote and tested all the codes locally on my own computer in Windows 11, by activating Conda and Jupyter Lab from Anaconda Prompt.
